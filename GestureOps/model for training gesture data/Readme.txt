Here's how you can collect the dataset  and train the model 

using collect_imgs.py

you can make number of classification you want and you can have dataset size as required 

use this to collect the data (image) and a folder will be generated with name of 'data' which will contain the dataset 

after collecting the dataset, you can use the create_dataset file in order to create the data set that can be used for training the model and this will generate the data.pickle which will be used for the train_classifier to train the model 

run the train_classifier to train the model (Random forest classifier)

you can use or run inference_classifier to check the model you have trained 

Note: 
- delete data , data.pickle and model.p if you are training the model with new data
